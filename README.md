# OpenFluidicArchitecture
An inexpensive, customizable and modular microfluidic system

Whew. 2 years of complete obsession, 10's of thousands of dollars, and countless late nights have led to this: The Open Fluidic Architecture. 
Designed to be inexspensive, accessable, and modular, this system takes advantage of common fabrication technologies to open the door to microfluidics 
in a way that has not been seen before. Whether you have a laser cutter, a vinyl cutter, a CNC mill, or just sticky tape and a steady hand, you'll be able to 
dip your toes into microfluidics using this project. 

This is a truly open source pursuit. Feel free to modify, distribute, and hack any and every bit of this in any way you see fit. My only request is to drop a reference
to me/this project. 

Questions? Please feel free to hit me up at abissell@stonefluidics.com and I'll do my best to answer them. 
I'm also down to talk about microfluidics anytime, anywhere, to anyone, for free (restrictions apply)
